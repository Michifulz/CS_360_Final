      Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The goal of this project was to design an application that could provide reminders to users based on events that they input into the application. 
   
      What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

The application would need to have log in, main, event management, and signup screens. When designing the UI I tried to keep users in mind by keeping the screens constant with their themes and simple to navigate. 
  
      How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

I used an iterative process to code this application. I started by first implementing the functionality of all of the buttons, this allowed for the application to be navigated and also allowed me to understand how each page related to each other. I worked from there to establish more functionality in a step-by-step process. 

      How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

I tested this application by trial and error. By using data both in the code and by using the Android Studios emulator to see what inputs would do. I tested as I was   building the application and each functionality. As I added a functionality I would test it, and see if it worked as I expected it to. If I didn’t get the outcome I was expecting I would search out why I was getting a different outcome. 
  
      Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

I faced many challenges during the development of this application, and there are many aspects of it that I would improve if given the opportunity. I’m not sure that I 
would call any particular aspect of what I did innovative, I feel that I used standard methods of problem-solving, designing, and creating to come to solutions.
  
      In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I think that I showed my skills the best with the UI section of the development process. The final design of the application was simple but effective at allowing users to navigate the application.
